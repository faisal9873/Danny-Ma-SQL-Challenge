# Danny-Ma-SQL-Challenge
The [8-week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) consists of eight different case studies curated by Danny Ma. These case studies cover business problems that we encounter day-to-day and require data analytics techniques to solve. 

This work consists of the solutions to case study 1 - [Danny's Diner](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). Here, Danny needs to use his data to answer simple questions that will help him determine how best to expand his customer loyalty program. The end goal is for Danny to expand his business to make more profit and we will be helping Danny using with the help of SQL statements.
